- 👋 Hi, I’m Richard, a backend software engineer.
- 💓 I enjoy designing complex systems to the ugliest 😋 details
     and making them go rarrr!!! as efficiently as possible.
- 📚 I'm got experience with Python, Django, Docker, PHP, WordPress, AWS,..
- 🤓 I geek out over anything tech, science or just innovative!
- 💞️ We should be friends. You'll love me.
